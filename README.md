# Read Me
This app use a SWT library, all dependencies are added in the pom file.
You should just compile it.

Some of features are not implemented yet, but interfaces are ready and they will approximatively be implemented in the same way,
using the same archi.
I used a factory "UserWindowFactory", hope it was a good idea from a Java√Øst ^^
Thanks for all :)
